-- Objective:
--   Understand financial exposure by payer: which payers
--   cover the most, which leave the most cost to patients,
--   and how many encounters had zero coverage.
--
-- Business questions answered:
--   • How many encounters had zero payer coverage, and what
--     % of total does that represent?
--   • What is the average total claim cost by payer?
--   • Which payer relationships are most profitable?
--   • Are uninsured volumes trending up or down?
--
-- Granularity: one row per payer
