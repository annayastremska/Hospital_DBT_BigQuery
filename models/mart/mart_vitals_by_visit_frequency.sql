-- ============================================================
-- mart_vitals_by_visit_frequency
-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   Compare average vital signs between the most-frequent
--   and least-frequent visitors (within 2022, the year for
--   which we have vitals data).
--
-- Clinical question:
--   "Do patients who visit most often show measurably worse
--    vitals than occasional visitors?"  If yes, frequent
--    visitors are likely the sicker, higher-acuity cohort
--    that needs dedicated care pathways.
--
-- Bucketing logic (fixed thresholds):
--   low_frequency    = 1-2 visits
--   medium_frequency = 3-5 visits
--   high_frequency   = 6+ visits
--
-- Granularity:
--   One row per frequency_bucket showing average vitals
--   and visit counts.
