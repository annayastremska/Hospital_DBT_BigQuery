-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   Single-row-per-year executive dashboard:
--   visit volume, revenue, payer coverage, average costs, and
--   patient count.  Each row = one calendar year.
--
-- Key business questions answered:
--   • Are visit volumes growing year-over-year?
--   • What is total and average revenue per encounter?
--   • What share of costs is covered by payers vs. patients?
--   • How many unique patients were active each year?
