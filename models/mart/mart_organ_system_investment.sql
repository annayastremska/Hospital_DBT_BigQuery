-- ============================================================
-- mart_organ_system_investment
-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   Identify which organ systems drive the most encounter
--   volume and revenue — the primary signal for equipment
--   and staffing investment decisions.
--
-- Business question:
--   "We think most patients come in for cardiac / vascular
--    issues. Should we invest in more equipment for those?"
--   This mart quantifies it so leadership can act on data,
--   not intuition.
--
-- Granularity: one row per organ_system per year
