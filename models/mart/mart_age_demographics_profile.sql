-- ============================================================
-- mart_age_demographics_profile
-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   Show how encounter volume, revenue, organ system mix, and
--   encounter class vary by patient age group and gender.
--   This is the "age" mart proposed in the brief.
--
-- Business & clinical questions:
--   • Which age groups consume the most healthcare resources?
--   • Do older patients skew toward inpatient / emergency?
--   • Are there gender differences in organ system utilisation?
--   • Where should preventive care programmes be targeted?
--
-- Granularity: one row per age_bucket × gender × organ_system
