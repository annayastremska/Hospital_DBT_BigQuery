-- ============================================================
-- mart_readmissions
-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   Identify patients readmitted within 30 days of a previous
--   encounter and surface common characteristics (age group,
--   organ system, encounter class) to detect avoidable
--   readmission patterns.
--
-- Clinical & financial relevance:
--   • Readmissions within 30 days are a standard quality
--     metric — payers (incl. CMS) penalise hospitals for them.
--   • Identifying the dominant organ systems and patient
--     profiles enables targeted discharge protocols.
--
-- Granularity:
--   Part A — patient-level flag (was_readmitted within 30d)
--   Part B — summary profile by organ_system + age_bucket
