-- ============================================================
-- mart_encounter_class_
-- ============================================================
-- Objective:
--   For every calendar year, show the percentage of total
--   encounters that belonged to each encounter class
--   (ambulatory, outpatient, wellness, urgentcare,
--    emergency, inpatient).
--
-- Business question:
--   "Has the share of emergency/inpatient visits changed
--    over time?  Are we seeing a shift toward preventive
--    (wellness) care?"  Trend shifts inform staffing,
--    bed capacity, and billing strategy.
--
-- Granularity: one row per year × encounter_class
